# Bouncing-Ball

# Description
My first project from my course with MIT xPro! The assignment was to create movement, with a ball that bounces across the screen while keeping track of boundaries and walls.

# How-To / Installation
To view this, all you need to do is download the folder to your device. Open the index.html file, and the program should begin to run!

# Info
As my first project, this was one I struggled with quite a lot, and admittedly, I wasn't very happy with my work. Since then, though, I've returned to my work, and I've been able to review it, improve on it, and make it work properly! This was definitely a learning opportunity, and all in all, I'm very happy with what I've achieved.
